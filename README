# Hostel Management System

## Introduction

The Hostel Management System (HMS) is designed to streamline and modernize the management of hostel-related activities for students and administrative bodies at NSUT. The current system relies on manual processes and outdated technology, leading to inefficiencies and security risks. HMS aims to address these issues by providing a digital platform for managing student accommodations, staff oversight, and hostel facilities.
